# election-analysis
python

In this challenge, we had a csv with election voting data by county.  We aggregated the data by candidate, and printed a summary of the results for the election such as total votes and votes by candidate, and then included a summary of the winner of this specific election.  The code within this project would be able to read a new file and print out a similar outline of another election provided the .csv file has a similar structure to the one used in this project.
